  - term: What is a file descriptor?
    definition: |
      An integer associated with an open file. But (and here's the catch), that file can be a `network connection`, a `FIFO`, a `pipe`, a `terminal`, a real on-the-disk `file`, or just about anything else.  Everything in Unix *is* a file.

      A file descriptor is a **small, non-negative integer** that a Unix or Unix-like operating system uses as a handle to access a file or other input/output resources, such as pipes and network sockets. (ChatGPT)

      When a **file** or **resource** is opened by a process, the operating system creates an **entry** to represent that file or resource and returns a **file descriptor**, which can then be used in further system calls to read from, write to, or manipulate the file or resource.
      
      * File descriptors are used by the operating system to manage the details of input/output operations without exposing the underlying complexity to programs. Typically, file descriptors refer to: **File descriptor 0**: Standard input (stdin). **File descriptor 1**: Standard output. **File descriptor 2**: Standard error (stderr) Beyond these, any new files or resources opened by a process are assigned incrementally higher numbers for their file descriptors.
