notes:
  - term: "IP Addresses"
    definition: "Unique identifiers for devices connected to a network, used for routing traffic."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3
  - term: "IPv4"
    definition: "Internet Protocol Version 4, uses 32-bit addresses, commonly written in dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.0.2.111)."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  - term: "IPv6"
    definition: "Internet Protocol Version 6, developed to address IPv4 exhaustion, uses 128-bit addresses, represented in hexadecimal and separated by colons."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  - term: "Subnets"
    definition: "Segments of a network, where the IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion to improve routing and management."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.1
  - term: "Netmask"
    definition: "A bitmask used to determine what subnet an IP address belongs to, by separating the network and host portions."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.1
  - term: "Port Numbers"
    definition: "16-bit numbers used alongside IP addresses to identify specific services or processes on a device."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.2
  - question: "What led to the development of IPv6?"
    answer: "The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, as predicted by Vint Cerf, necessitated the development of IPv6 to provide a vastly larger address space."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  - question: "How are IPv6 addresses simplified in notation?"
    answer: "IPv6 addresses can compress zeros using double colons and omit leading zeros in each byte pair for brevity."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  - question: "What is the purpose of subnets?"
    answer: "Subnets help organize a network into manageable parts, allowing for efficient routing and management by separating network and host identifiers."
    reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.1
  - question: "How do port numbers function in network communications?"
    answer: "Port numbers identify specific applications or services on a device, allowing multiple services to operate through a single IP address."
