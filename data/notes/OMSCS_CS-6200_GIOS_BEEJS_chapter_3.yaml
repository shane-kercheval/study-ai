notes:
- term: "IP Addresses"
  definition: "Unique identifiers for devices connected to a network, used for routing traffic."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3
  uuid: 1e16ee44-77e0-47d7-af51-e82980a6ff64
- term: "IPv4"
  definition: "Internet Protocol Version 4, uses 32-bit addresses, commonly written in dot-decimal notation (e.g., 192.0.2.111)."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  uuid: 40d2d187-4b6b-4c92-bf3a-3e48c0b04fd5
- term: "IPv6"
  definition: "Internet Protocol Version 6, developed to address IPv4 exhaustion, uses 128-bit addresses, represented in hexadecimal and separated by colons."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  uuid: ef153bdb-68d5-40ae-83ca-c34c632da7be
- term: "Subnets"
  definition: "Segments of a network, where the IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion to improve routing and management."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.1
  uuid: 90e64c40-c4a3-48b1-af5b-c7007c4af6b8
- term: "Netmask"
  definition: "A bitmask used to determine what subnet an IP address belongs to, by separating the network and host portions."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.1
  uuid: 9ec28a0a-7052-4bb5-930d-92b5db6cd158
- term: "Port Numbers"
  definition: "16-bit numbers used alongside IP addresses to identify specific services or processes on a device."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1.2
  uuid: 57f11513-a1a6-44f6-88c5-717f16c43518
- question: "What led to the development of IPv6?"
  answer: "The exhaustion of IPv4 addresses, as predicted by Vint Cerf, necessitated the development of IPv6 to provide a vastly larger address space."
  reference: https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/html/#what-is-a-socket; chapter 3.1
  uuid: dd4eb4b9-1f05-4ffa-a431-d8d5d359df5c
- question: "How are IPv6 addresses simplified in notation?"
  answer: "IPv6 addresses can compress zeros using double colons and omit leading zeros in each byte pair for brevity."

  uuid: 61782734-743d-44ed-951b-b0240b0dec14
- question: "What is the purpose of subnets?"
  answer: "Subnets help organize a network into manageable parts, allowing for efficient routing and management by separating network and host identifiers."

  uuid: 262f8b96-8883-4b96-9af9-e6aea0b9f5c9
- question: "How do port numbers function in network communications?"
  answer: "Port numbers identify specific applications or services on a device, allowing multiple services to operate through a single IP address."
