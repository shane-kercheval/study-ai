       "\n",
       "**Abstract Simplified**\n",
       "We created a new way to test if large language models (like GPT-4) can provide accurate, long answers across a variety of topics. We made a big list of questions (called LongFact) covering 38 topics. Then, we introduced a new method (named SAFE) that uses a language model to check if the answers are true by searching the web. We also came up with a scoring system that considers both the number of correct facts and the desired length of an answer. Our tests showed that this method is better and much cheaper than asking people to check the answers. We also found that bigger language models tend to give more accurate long answers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Introduction Simplified**\n",
       "Even though large language models have gotten really good, they often make mistakes when giving detailed answers. They might get dates wrong or make up things about well-known people. We aim to improve how we test these models for accuracy by introducing a new set of questions (LongFact), a checking method (SAFE), and a scoring system that looks at answer accuracy and length. Our tests show that our method works well and is much cheaper than using people to check answers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**LongFact Simplified**\n",
       "There aren't many good tests for seeing if language models can provide long, accurate answers on a wide range of topics. So, we made LongFact by asking GPT-4 to come up with lots of questions that need detailed answers. These questions cover 38 different topics. This is the first big test of its kind for checking detailed answer accuracy across many subjects.\n",
       "\n",
       "**SAFE Simplified**\n",
       "Judging the accuracy of long answers is tricky. We suggest focusing on checking each fact in an answer separately and using web searches to see if they're true. Our method, SAFE, breaks down answers into facts, decides if they're relevant, and then checks them online. This approach helps us accurately judge if a detailed answer is true or not.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Comparing SAFE to Human Checkers Simplified**\n",
       "When we compared our SAFE method to answers checked by humans, SAFE agreed with the human checkers 72% of the time. In cases where they disagreed, SAFE was right 76% of the time. Also, SAFE was more than 20 times less expensive than using human checkers. This shows that our method not only works well but can also save a lot of money.\n",
       "\n",
       "**F1@K: A New Scoring System Simplified**\n",
       "We want detailed answers to be both accurate and comprehensive. Our new scoring system, F1@K, helps us measure both by considering how many facts in an answer are correct and how the length of the answer matches what we're looking for. This helps us better understand how well a model can provide detailed, accurate information.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Testing Larger Language Models Simplified**\n",
       "We tested 13 different language models to see how well they could provide detailed, accurate answers using our new methods. Bigger models generally did better, giving more accurate and comprehensive answers. This suggests that as models get larger, they might also become more reliable in giving long, detailed answers.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Related Work and Limitations Simplified**\n",
       "Other studies have tried to test models' accuracy with short answers or on specific topics. Our work aims to check accuracy in long, detailed answers across many topics. While our method is a big improvement, it relies on the ability of language models to follow instructions and on the assumption that web searches can always provide the right facts to check an answer. There might also be cases where Google Search doesnâ€™t have all the answers, so there's still room for improvement."
