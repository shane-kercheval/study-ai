Take the text below and improve the structure/formatting of these notes so that they are in markdown and optimized to study.

It is very important to follow these rules:

- Be thorough and include all information needed to study and learn the material.
- Convert the "conversational tone" into structured notes.
- Each section should start with level 2 headers ("##"). Do not use level 1 headers (#).
- Format important terms with ticks (i.e. "`<term>`"). "Terms" refers to new words/phrases that I should memorize the definition of. 
- Format important concepts in bold (i.e "**<concept>**")
- Format critical concepts using this format "==<critical concept>==" (the "==" acts as highlighting in my notes app)

For context, formatting terms with ticks will help me scan for all of the definitions I should know. Formatting concepts in bold will help me quickly read and review. Highlighting critical concepts with "==" will help me find the most important things I should study when reviewing.
