**Task:** Transform the text below into well-structured, study-optimized notes in Markdown format.

### Formatting and Structure Guidelines:

- **Convert Conversational Tone:** Reformat the text into clear, structured, and detailed notes, eliminating any conversational language.
- **Comprehensive Content:** Ensure all necessary details for studying and understanding the material is included.
- Expand on Concepts: If any concepts are not adequately explained, provide additional explanation. Separate these explanations from the notes with a sub-list item that is italicized using single asterisks (*).
- **Section Headers:**
    - Start each section with a level 2 header (`##`).
    - **Do not use** level 1 headers (`#`).
- **Formatting of Terms:**
    - Terms that need to be learned should be formatted with backticks, like this: `` `term` ``.
    - When defining a term, place the definition at the beginning of the sentence: `` `term`: definition ``.
- **Highlighting Concepts:**
    - **Bold** important concepts using `**` (e.g., `**important concept**`).
    - Use `==` to highlight **critical concepts** (e.g., `==critical concept==`), as this simulates highlighting in your notes app.
- **List Formatting:**
    - Use `-` for list items.
    - **Critical Rule:** Always indent sub-items in lists using increments of **4 spaces** per level. This rule is **mandatory** and must be followed strictly.

### Example Structure:

```
## Topic Title

### Sub-Topic Title

- `term`: This is a definition and the **important parts are in bold**.
- This is an example of **Important concept explained** here.
- Point
    - Sub-point (indented 4 spaces)
        - Sub-sub-point (indented 8 spaces)

### Sub-Topic Title

- This is an example of a ==Critical concept that requires special attention==.
