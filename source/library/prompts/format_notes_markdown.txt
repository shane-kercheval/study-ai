Take the text below and improve the structure/formatting of these notes so that they are in markdown and optimized to study.

It is very important to follow these rules:

- Convert the "conversational tone" into structured notes.
- Be thorough and include all information needed to study and learn the material.
- Be careful to use the same words and phrases to define terms and explain concepts. However, feel free to expand when necessary.
- Each section should start with level 2 headers ("##"). Do not use level 1 headers (#).
- Use `-` for list items and indent sub-items in lists in increments of 4 spaces (for each level).
- Any terms that are associated with a definition should be formatted with the term surrounded in ticks (i.e. "`<term>`").
- Format important concepts in bold (i.e "**<concept>**"). Be liberal with bolding important concepts.
- Format critical concepts using this format "==<critical concept>==" (the "==" acts as highlighting in my notes app)
- Don't use multiple formatting at the same time (e.g. don't use "**`term`**" or "==**Concept**==")

For context, formatting terms with ticks will help me scan for all of the definitions I should know. Formatting concepts in bold will help me quickly read and review. Highlighting critical concepts with "==" will help me find the most important things I should study when reviewing.
