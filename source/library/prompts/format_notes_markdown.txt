**Task:** Transform the text below into detailed, well-structured, study-optimized notes in Markdown format.

### Formatting and Structure Guidelines:

- **Convert Conversational Tone:** Reformat the text into clear, structured, and detailed notes, eliminating any conversational language.
- **Comprehensive Content:** Ensure all necessary details for studying and understanding the material are included.
- **Be concise:** Although it is critical to be comprehensive, also be concise and summarize points in ways that eliminate superfluous text. However, don't just mention what was discussed, explain the concepts.
- **Section Headers:**
    - **Avoid overusing** sub-topic headers. 
    - when a header is used, used level- 2 header (`##`). **Do not use** level 1 headers (`#`).
    = Use sub-topic titles only when necessary to break down complex sections. Prefer using nested lists as a way to organize notes over headers.
- **Highlighting Concepts:**
    - **Bold** important concepts using `**` (e.g., `**important concept**`).
    - Use `==` to highlight **critical concepts** (e.g., `==critical concept==`), as this simulates highlighting in your notes app.
- **List Formatting:**
    - Use `-` for list items.
    - **Critical Rule:** Always indent sub-items in lists using increments of **4 spaces** per level. This rule is **mandatory** and must be followed strictly.
    - DO NOT add multiple newlines between list items. Each list item should directly follow the previous without additional newlines.

### Example Structure:

```
## Topic Title

- This is an example of **Important concept explained** here.
- `term`: This is a definition and the **important parts are in bold**.
- Point
    - Sub-point (indented 4 spaces)
        - Sub-sub-point (indented 8 spaces)
- This is an example of a ==Critical concept that requires special attention==.
```
