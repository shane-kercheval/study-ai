       "In a 2015 paper, HANDS-ON MACHINE LEARNING WITH SCIKIT-LEARN...ed a technique called *batch normalization (BN)* that addresses these problems. The technique consists of adding an operation in the model just before or after the activation function of each hidden layer. This operation simply zero-centers and normalizes each input, then scales and shifts the result using two new parameter vectors per layer: one for scaling, the other for shifting. In other words, the operation lets the model learn the optimal scale and mean of each of the layer’s inputs. In many cases, if you add a BN layer as the very first layer of your neural network, you do not need to standardize your training set. That is, there’s no need for StandardScaler or Normalization; the BN layer will do it for you (well, approximately, since it only looks at one batch at a time, and it can also rescale and shift each input feature).\n",

       "In order to zero-center and normalize the inputs, the algorithm needs to estimate each input’s mean and standard deviation. It does so by evaluating the mean and standard deviation of the input over the current mini-batch (hence the name “batch normalization”). The whole operation is summarized step by step in *Equation 11-4*.\n",
